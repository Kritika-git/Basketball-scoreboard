## Overview

A simple basketball scoreboard web app built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

This app allows you to keep track of scores for two teams: **Home** and **Guest**.  
You can increment their scores by 1, 2, or 3 points with dedicated buttons.  

There is also an **End Game** button that displays the winner, and a **Restart** button to reset scores and start fresh.
